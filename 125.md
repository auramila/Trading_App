# Sprint 2 Part 5: Building a Chatbot with Streamlit

**Description:**

In this project, you will need to build a chatbot using streamlit and langchain (optionally). You can then deploy this chatbot to the Internet!

**Topics:**



* Chatbots
* ChatGPT
* Prompt Engineering
* Streamlit / Next.js
* LangChain

**Prerequisites:**



* Python / TypeScript knowledge
* Knowledge of ChatGPT
* Knowledge of OpenAI API
* Basic knowledge of Streamlit / Next.js

**Estimated time to complete:** 8 hours


## Task Description

We want to congratulate you on reaching the end of Sprint 2. It is time to build something cool and chatty.

You will build your own chatbot app like ChatGPT. Your users can then visit that chatbot and talk with it!

**We will be using LangChain and your framework (Streamlit or Next.js) of choice.**

**The intended code editor for this project is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).** \
 \
The chatbot would work like this. The user enters an API key for OpenAI. A greeting message appears from the bot. The user will chat with the bot and receive answers. Bot will be ultimately calling the OpenAI API. 

There will be plenty of opportunities to improve the bot with different functionality.

All of the front-end work will be handled by your selected framework (Streamlit or Next.js).

**If you feel confident in Python or have experience in software engineering, feel free to over-engineer the app with adding different things from the optional tasks and coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!**

Remember, you have all of your tools at your disposal if, for some reason, you get stuck or need inspiration: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or your friend!


## Task Requirements

**The exact task requirements are as follows:** 

1. Figure out how your chatbot will work. 

2. Create an OpenAI API Key for this project. 

3. Use the available components from StreamLit or Next.js ecosystem, or write your own components. If you want to use Python and Next.js at the same time (harder) or other JS frontend frameworks, please do, but understand that this will take more time. 

4. Tune at least one OpenAI setting (temperature, Top-p, frequency, etc).

5. Add at least one security guard to your app to prevent misuse, like users trying to jailbreak your app or writing biased prompts. Be creative! 

6. Use LangChain for calling the OpenAI API. 

7. The user should be able to send messages to the bot and get replies. 

## 


## Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose one or more improvements from this list.
The list is sorted by difficulty levels. 

**Caution: Some of the tasks in medium or hard categories may contain tasks with concepts or libraries that may be introduced in later sections or even require outside knowledge/time to research outside of the course.**

**Easy:**
1. Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides. 
2. Improving the chatbot to be more specialized for your specific domain: IT, HR, marketing, finance, etc. 
3. Adding a separate text field for the system prompt. 
4. Implementing more security constraints, like user input validation and system prompt validation. Could we consider utilizing ChatGPT to verify these aspects?
5. Add an interactive help feature or chatbot guide explaining how to use the app. 

**Medium:**
1. Adding all of the OpenAI settings (models, temperature, frequency, etc.) for the user to tune as sliders/fields.
2. Deploying your app to the Internet. 
3. Calculating and providing output to the user on the price of the prompt.
4. Read [OpenAI API ](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) documentation, think of your own improvement, and implement it.
5. Implement function calling [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), like a calculator, a map renderer, currency converter, etc. 
6. Try to jailbreak (break into) your own application. Provide the results of this experiment in an Excel sheet.
7. Adding RAG functionality to the app: adding a knowledge base, retrieving when a similar is found, and sending it to ChatGPT. 
8. Provide the user with the ability to choose from a list of LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for this project.
9. Think of a creative way; how could you use image generation inside this project and implement it using code?
10. Allow users to download conversations or generated data in formats like PDF, CSV, or JSON. 

**Hard:**
1. Using Streamlit (Python) or React (JS) components, implementing a full-fledged chatbot application instead of a one-time call to the OpenAI API.
2. Deploy your app to one of these cloud providers: Gemini, AWS, or Azure.
3. Add a vector database to your project (saving, comparing, and calculating vectors).
4. Use open-source LLMs (not Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for the project.
5. [Fine-tine](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) an LLM to have an interview preparation focus.
6. Add User Session Management to log in, register, and save chat history for the user.
7. Implement secure and anonymized logging to track errors and performance without exposing sensitive data.

## Evaluation Criteria

* The learner understands the basic principles of how the program works.
* The learner knows how to use a front-end library using their knowledge and/or external resources (Internet, Chat-GPT, etc.)
* The learner’s project works as intended; you can chat with a chatbot and get answers.
* The learner understands the potential problems with the application. He can offer suggestions on improving the code and the project.
* The learner understands differences between user, system, and assistant roles.
* The learner understands how the chatbot differs from ChatGPT.
* For the maximum mark, complete **at least 2 medium and hard optional tasks**.



## How to get started with Streamlit (for Python developers)

It is very likely that you are seeing and hearing about Streamlit for the first time. No worries!

It's a fantastic framework for creating interactive web apps using Python, particularly for **data visualization**, **machine learning demos**, and **quick prototyping**.

You don’t need to know much about front-end things, like HTML, CSS, JS, React, or others, to build apps! Streamlit will do the basics of front-end for you by just writing Python code.

**Learning Streamlit:**



* You can get started by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&ab_channel=pixegami). 
* After that, check out their [page](https://streamlit.io/). 
* Check their documentation on[ page elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference). 
* A good starting point could be their [“Get Started” section](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started).
* Lastly, GeeksForGeeks also offers a good tutorial on [Streamlit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-beginners-guide-to-streamlit/).
* [YouTube short.](https://youtube.com/shorts/iPj6QKMd8qA?si=d0i19vdfr3x4jAn0)
* Tutorial on using Streamlit in [VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2siBrMsqF44&ab_channel=TechWithTim).


## How to use Next.js for RAG (for JS developers)

You can either choose one of the following:

- Next.js from scratch, either `create-next-app` or the project template from the previous project
- [LangChain's Next.js template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template) with some RAG functionality
- some other JS full-stack framework or a Python backend + JS frontend project

We recommend using the LangChain's Next.js template for most learners, as it is the most straightforward way to get started. However, since it already has some of the requirements implemented, we expect you to implement at least one optional task (apart from a solution critique) to get the maximum mark. Also, do not forget to delete the unused code from the template, since it provides multiple flows that you might not need.

Since this is not your first project and we expect you to have some TypeScript experience, we believe you do not need much hand-holding to get started. However, if you need help, you can always ask your peers or JTLs for help.

## Approach to solving the task



* 1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:
    * Understanding this task better
    * Writing the code
    * Improving the code.
    * Understanding the code.
* You can also take a look at the “How to Get Started sections to better understand how to get started with Streamlit or Next.js.
* If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in Sprint 1 OR check out additional resources.
* If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs. 
* Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else—whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.
